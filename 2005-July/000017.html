 &lt;br&gt;jIRCii has been a work in progress for a long time now.  I originally started it as a project to learn java while in high school.  I tinkered with it as a hobby throughout college.  I didn't make that final push to create a release quality product until now though.  Anyways with such a long history as a project there are to many people to thank so I'm going to keep this list short.

+    Beleive it or not this actually isn't a bug.  jIRCii binds Ctrl+X by
