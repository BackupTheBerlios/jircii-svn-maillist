-12. I can't cut text with Ctrl+X, what's wrong?
+12. How do I cycle channels in the status window?
 
-    Beleive it or not this actually isn't a bug.  jIRCii binds Ctrl+X by
-    default to switch the current active query in case you are IRC'ing out
-    of your status window (i.e. all auto /window options turned off).  
+    In the past, jIRCii bound Ctrl+X to do this ala BitchX.  Many Windows 
+    users complained that they could not cut text and rogue contributors
+    removed this feature.  
 
-    This is consistent with the Ctrl+X binding used by BitchX.  If you would
-    like Ctrl+X to provide the normal service of cutting text, paste the
-    following into notepad, save it, and load it into jIRCii:
+    To try to ease the pain, Ctrl+Z has been bound to the previous behavior
+    of Ctrl+X.  jIRCii binds Ctrl+Z by default to switch the current active 
+    query in case you are IRC'ing out of your status window (i.e. all auto 
+    /window options turned off).  
 
+    If you would like Ctrl+X to provide the service of cycling active channels,

-34. Why don't you allow plugins written in Java, C, Python, Visual Basic etc.?
+34. How do I strip jIRCii's GUI to only the essentials?
 
+    Yes, the true power of jIRCii is you can have a GUI client that feels like
+    mIRC or you can strip it down to the bare essentials so you feel like you
+    are irc'ing out of a terminal window.  The choice of which extreme and to
+    which extent is yours.  
+
+    To disable all of the GUI elements in jIRCii:
+    a. Select View-&gt;Options-&gt;Auto /Window
+    b. Disable auto /window for everything (you can reenable this stuff later
+       but ideally, I assume you want to IRC out of one window, correct?)
+    c. Select the &quot;GUI Setup&quot; item from the left hand side tree control.
+    d. Uncheck all items under &quot;Interface Elements&quot;
+    e. Select the &quot;&quot;Switchbar&quot; item from the left hand side tree control.
+    f. Uncheck &quot;Enable Switchbar&quot;
+    g. Click &quot;Ok&quot;.
+
+    Now on some operating systems, upon restarting jIRCii, you will notice
+    a 1 pixel border around the jIRCii window.  If you want to get rid of this
+    (afterall, every pixel is valuable) then type the following in a jIRCii
+    window:
+
+    h. /eval setProperty(&quot;notabs.border&quot;, 0);
+
+    Now comes the final step:
+
+    i. restart jIRCii for everything to take effect.
+
+    Before you know it, you'll be irc'ing console style.  pHEAR!

 - Updated to Sleep 2.1-b14 (is it even released yet?).  Lots of changes.
-  Scripters (and indirectly users) shall be pleased.  
   See the full changelog at: <A HREF="http://sleep.hick.org/changelog.html">http://sleep.hick.org/changelog.html</A>
+
+  Highlights include:
+  -- Addition of try/catch blocks and a throw command
+  -- Watch variables to assist with debugging 
+  -- an include function for including external files into a script
+  -- a profiler for seeing where your scripts spend all their time
+  -- assignment ops i.e. +=, *=, /= etc.  
+  -- performance enhancements and several bug fixes!!
+
 - Fixed a bug where a popup trigger on MacOS X could also trigger a
   mouse clicked event (causing inadvertant creation of query windows
   even when you don't want them).
 - Fixed a bug that caused psuedo transparency image to be recalculated 
-  with every window resize.  Made psuedo transparency mode incredibly slow.
+  with every window resize.  Resizing with psuedo transparency should feel
+  a little faster now.
+- Disabled apple.awt.showGrowBox property in Info.plist, this stops the 
+  drawing of the OS X grow box in the lower right corner (functionallity it
+  is still there, this just prevents the box itself from obscuring the client)
+- jIRCii Weblaunch/command line options to specify irc URL now allows
+  <A HREF="ircs://">ircs://</A> URLs for connecting to an SSL server.  Port information is allowed
+  as well.
